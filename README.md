- The player's score is tracked throughout the game.
- The game asks the player if they want to play again after finishing a round.
- The game displays the name, year, and genre of the TV series.

## Python Features Used

- `import` statement to include required modules
- `def` statement to define functions
- `while` loop to keep the game running until the player chooses to stop
- `if-elif-else` statement to evaluate the user's input and check the correctness of the answer
- `input()` function to get user input
- `print()` function to display information to the console
- `choice()` function to randomly select TV series from the pre-defined list
- `lambda` function to clear the console screen
